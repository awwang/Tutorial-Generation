# Tutorial-Generation
This is a Unity app intended for the creation of tutorials on the HoloLens using an existing tutorial software framework.

## App Usage
1. Upon startup, users will be greeted with instructions to state the title of the tutorial to be created.
2. The commands, "Next," "Start recording," "Snap," and "Complete" are be used to navigate the app.
   - "Next" progresses from step to step.
   - "Start recording" activates voice dictation to record the instructions.
   - "Snap" records an image for that step.
   - "Complete" ends the tutorial and saves the JSON file.
